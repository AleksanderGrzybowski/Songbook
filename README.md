This is an app made for myself, which can be used to create a personal songbook. Includes full-text filtering, basic CRUD and batch import/export.

Cool stuff used:
* Spring Boot with almost 100% unit test coverage for core components
* React + Redux + Bootstrap

Backend: `./gradlew bootRun`, frontend: `npm start`.
